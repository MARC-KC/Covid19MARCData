# Mid-America Regional Council's COVID-19 Data

This repository holds all the code [MARC](https://www.marc.org/) uses to keep their COVID-19 Data Hub up to date for the [Kansas City](https://marc2.org/covidhub/) and [Northern and Southern Health Care Coalition](https://marc2.org/hcchub/) Regions. It exposes the entire process for downloading the most up-to-date datasets from our MARC Data API and transforming it to the forms needed to feed the [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://marc2.org/covidhub/).

## How to use this repository?

### If you just want to download the base datasets directly as a zipped set of csv files:

[<img src="man/figures/downloadPowerBiCSVs.png" height="50px" title="Download All Power BI COVID-19 Datasets as Zipped CSV's">](https://marc2.org/coviddata/CovidData_PBI.zip)
[<img src="man/figures/downloadWeeklySnapshotCSVs.png" height="50px" title="Download All Weekly Data Snapshot COVID-19 Datasets as Zipped CSV's">](https://marc2.org/coviddata/CovidData_WDS.zip)


These files are updated as part of our process for pushing updated data to our publication server so they should match the data in the MARC Data API.

### If you want access to the API directly, the GET URL's are as follows:

*  Case, Death, and Test Data: </br><https://gis2.marc2.org/MARCDataAPI/api/covidcasedeathtest>  
    *  This is the time series of the back-updated Case, Death, Test data that MARC uses
*  Newly Reported Case, Death, and Test Data: </br><https://gis2.marc2.org/MARCDataAPI/api/covidcasedeathtestnewlyreported>
    *  This is the time series of Newly Reported Case, Death, Test data that MARC uses to provide an estimate of how many Cases, Deaths, and Tests were reported in the last 24 hours similar to how the media reports these values. This data is not back-updated.
*  Hospital Data: </br><https://gis2.marc2.org/MARCDataAPI/api/covidhospital>
    *  This is the time series of the back-updated Hospital data that MARC uses
*  **Note** The LastUpdated columns are in UTC time if downloading directly from the API. The time conversion to 'America/Chicago'/'Central' is implemented when downloading from the R package with the function `downloadMARCCovidData()`


### If you want to implement the API or the R package into your pipeline using R

This repository is actually an R package made for this purpose. MARC uses this package to make sure the data being displayed through Power BI on the [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://marc2.org/covidhub/) stays up to date.

#### Make sure dependencies are installed:

Programs to install:

* R (From CRAN; latest version at time of writing was 4.0.3)
* RStudio (Helpful R IDE)

Once these programs are installed. Open up RStudio and install the {remotes} package by running:  
```{r}
install.packages('remotes')
```


Then install the Covid19MARCData package from this repository with:
```{r}
remotes::install_github('MARC-KC/Covid19MARCData')
```
This will launch a process that may install a bunch of packages that the Covid19MARCData package is dependent upon. Once completed you should be able to load the new package with:
```{r}
library(Covid19MARCData)
```
This will attach the package to your environment and allow you to call the package functions. See the section [Using the R package Covid19MARCData](#using-the-r-package-covid19marcdata) for more information.


## Using the R package Covid19MARCData 

#### Download the data

This is similar to calling the API directly, except that it loads the resulting table into the R session and does the conversion of the LastUpdated columns from UTC to Central time.  
You can download all three datasets using the same function with a different `type` argument:
```{r}
#Case, Death, and Test Data
cdtData <- downloadMARCCovidData(dataset = "CDT")

#Newly Reported Case, Death, and Test Data
cdtNRData <-  downloadMARCCovidData(dataset = "CDT_NewlyReported")

#Hospital Data
hospData <-  downloadMARCCovidData(dataset = "Hospital")
```

Or you can download all three of these datasets with a single command as a list of data.frames:
```{r}
downloadAllCovidAPIData()
```

Or you can download all three datasets and create the base derived datasets with:
```{r}
getBaseCovidData()
```


#### Create Derived Datasets for visualizations

There are two main products that MARC produces using this data.These include both the Kansas City Region and HCC Northern and Southern Regional COVID-19 Data Hubs and the Weekly Data Snapshots. The returns from `createBiDatasets_Hub()` and `createBiDatasets_WDS()` will be a list of the created data.frames.

All of the datasets used to produce the figures for the COVID-19 Data Hubs can be created using the following function:
```{r}
createBiDatasets_Hub()
```


All of the datasets used to produce the figures and summaries for the Weekly Data Snapshot can be created using the following function:
```{r}
createBiDatasets_WDS()
```

In order to keep our products up to date, we run both of these functions during our morning and nightly updates is a pattern like:
```{r}
#Download in the most recent data from the API 
apiData <- Covid19MARCData::downloadAllCovidAPIData()

#Create the base datasets
baseData <- getBaseCovidData(apiData)

#Create the datasets needed for the COVID-19 Hubs
dfListHub <- createBiDatasets_Hub(baseDataList = baseData, lagDaysCDT = 10, lagDaysHosp = 2)

#Create the datasets needed for the Weekly Data Snapshot
dfListWDS <- createBiDatasets_WDS(baseDataList = baseData, cutoffDay = 'Sunday', lagDaysCDT = 10, lagDaysHosp = 2)

#Output the data as CSV's for consumption by Power Bi
names(apiData) <- glue::glue("bi_base_{names(apiData)}")
list2CSV(c(apiData, dfListHub, dfListWDS))
```
